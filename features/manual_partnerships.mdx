Disabling automatic partnerships allows for partnership requests (otherwise known as manual partnerships) to be enabled. When you set up the bot, you provide a `request_partner_channel` channel. When someone partners with you when you have partnership requests enabled, a partnership request will be sent to that channel for approval before being sent to the partnership channel.

## How it works with [`/find-partners`](commands#find-partners)

The `partner` button has been renamed to `Request Partnership` for a bigger indication of partnership requests being enabled.

## How it works with [`/partner`](commands#partner)

Instead of the partnership being completed, the request is sent instead.
