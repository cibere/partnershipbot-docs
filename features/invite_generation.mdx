To not only help invites never expire, but also help with getting an accurate count of how many peopled joined from a certain partnership.

## When invites are generated

Invites can be generated from any of the following cases:

1. An invite can be generated from a partnership. Either from their ad, or from [`/partnerships list`](commands#partnerships_list)
2. An invite can be generated from someone viewing your server as a potential partner. This is from [`/find-partners`](commands#find-partners)
3. An invite can be generated from a partnership request. When you submit a partnership request, the bot has a button which will invite the reviewing staff member into your server for futher investigation.
