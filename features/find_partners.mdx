We provide two main methods of partnering with servers.

## Browsing Eligable Servers

With [`/find-partners`](/commands#find-partners) you can browse servers that fit your requirements, and that you fit theirs. There are even extra filters you can use, but I go more into that in the in that command's section.

## Partnering with mutual servers

You can run [`/partner`](/commands#partner) to partner with a server that you share with the bot.
