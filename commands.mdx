Useage: `/settings quick-setup`

Gives you a quick and easy way to setup the bot.

By default this is hidden to users without the `manage_server` permission. See [the integration guide](guides/integration_settings) to see how to change this.

<Note>
  After the command is ran, the bot will give you a modal so you can paste in
  your ad. Please do not put your discord invite in there, see the [invite
  generation feature](features/invite_generation) to learn why.
