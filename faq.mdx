# Q: Why does the bot need each of its permissions?

- `Manage Server`: to get an accurate count of who joined because of a certain partnership, the bot needs to be able to fetch the server's invites. This can only be done with the manage server permission.
- `Manage Channels`: This is used to receive the event from discord which indicates when an invite has been deleted rather than expiring or getting used to its max uses. This is some extra protection from a server potentially boosting their join count.
- `Create Instant Invite` / `Create Invites`: To avoid invites expiring, the bot will create an invite for the user when they want to join a server because of a partnership
- `Send Messages`: When a partnership/request is initiated, the bot needs to be able to send the message in the corosponding channel
- `Embed Link`: This is needed so the bot can send embeds

# Q: Why is the bot not accurately displaying how many people joined from a partnership?

There are a couple reasons for this

1. The bot does not have the `Manage Server` permission, so it's not able to fetch the server invites. Without being able to fetch the server invites, the bot is unable to accurately tell when someone joins normally, or when someone joins due to a partnership.

2. The bot was offline while some people joined. The bot is unable to update how many people joined if its offline
3. The person has joined via a partnership previously. When someone joins from a partnership, it only counts it the first time they join that server from a partnership.
