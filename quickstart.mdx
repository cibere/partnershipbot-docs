## Inviting the bot

Step 1 is adding the bot to your server. You can do that by clicking [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1129577805726875658&permissions=18481&scope=bot%20applications.commands), selecting your server, and pressing invite.

<Note>
  Make sure to invite the bot with all of the permissions is requires. See
  [here](https://partner-docs.cibere.dev/faq#q-why-does-the-bot-need-each-of-its-permissions)
  for a breakdown on why it needs each one.
</Note>

## Configuring the bot

The easiest way to configure the bot is by running [`/settings quick-setup`](/commands/settings#quick-setup), and passing all of the required values.

<Note>
  Before running the command, make sure you have your server's ad (without the
  discord invite) copied to your clipboard.

## Find partners

Thanks it, you have now setup the bot. There are two main ways to partner with servers:

### Browsing servers

To browse servers, you can run [`/find-partners`](commands/find-partners). By default, this only shows servers that fit your requirements, and they fit yours. Though you can add extra filters with the command's arguments.

### Partner with a mutual server

To partner with a server you share with the bot, you can run [`/partner`](commands/partner).
